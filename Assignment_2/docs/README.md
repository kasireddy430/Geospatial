# Probe Data Analysis for Road Slope


### What youâ€™ll need
+ A favorite text editor or IDE (Intellij or Ecliplse IDE)
+ JDK 8 or later


### Steps to Run the project 
+ Open MapMatching.java and update the probeFilePath in line 26 and linkFilePath in line 28
+ Run the MapMatching.java file 

### Output from the code is copied into the ProbeDataAnalysis folder with the below names
+ Partition6467MatchedPoints.csv
+ SlopeEvaluation.csv

### Notes
+ We have considered all the  probe points to calculate the slope 
+ We would need about 4 hrs to complete slope calculation along with the map matching procedures.
+ Slope is caluculated for all the probes belonging to the same road link 
+ Partition6467MatchedPoints.csv has column specifying the slope calculated
+ SlopeEvaluation.csv has data related to mean slope calculated per link and the given mean slope
