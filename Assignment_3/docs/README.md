###  Satellite-Aerial-Image-Retrieval
+ To automatically download aerial imagery (maximum resolution available) given a lat/lon bounding box. 

### STEPS:
+ Convert the input latitude/longitude coordinates (in degrees) into pixel XY coordinates at a specified map size.
+ Convert pixel XY coordinates into tile XY coordinates of the tile containing the specified pixel.
+ Validate the tile values for both coordinates.
+ Proximity of points i.e. must not lie on the same tile.
+ Transform tiles into main diagonal form for convenience.
+ Determine the bounding tiles with highest level of detail.
+ Converts tiles XY into a QuadKey and then download the images corresponding to the QuadKey
+ Save the bounding image names using hash function and stitch these images based on it. 
+ Write the final image on to disk.

### Setting Up Default Values:
+ To run the code, you need to change the basefolder’s name to the folder’s name you use.
+ The license does not have to be changed.

### How To Run The Code?
+ The code could be run as follow:

Type the input coordinates into the main function at the end of AerialImageRetrieval.py file I have selected 4. If you want to change uncomment it and run it

### By default, we provide five examples of coordintates :
+ IIT Stuart building
+ Chicago Navy Pier
+ Statue of Liberty, NYC.
+ Chicago Bean
+ Eiffel Tower
